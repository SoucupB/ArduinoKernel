  ArduinoKernel is a simple micro kernel which provides ultility functions(like a real operating system) for folders and file manipulation.
It also provides a simple asm compiler within it.
The only backside is that it is still quite unstable but is great for arduino school projects or just to learn from it.
Language C only, despite the fact that ino files are C++ there is a version which can be compiled with 
"gcc" in clibs subdirectory.
